Objective: place objects in certain positions and leave the location.

There are 2 types of bots at the location: the simple ones and the bosses. Simple bots patrol the location and go to the boss (which is assigned to this bot) if they find the player, to to tell the boss where is the player.

I made Garage models on my own in Blender.

Bots logic is made with the help of blueprint class AIController, not with behavior tree.
